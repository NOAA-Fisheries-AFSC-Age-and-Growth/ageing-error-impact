# ageing-error-impact
Scripts and files for a simulation-based approach to evaluate effect of ageing error in reference ages on model-based age predictions. Code for Arrington et al. 2023 in FT-NIRs Workshop Proceedings. 

**Scripts:**

first_simulate_age_data_errormat: script to simulate age data from ageing error matrix estimated by puntilizer (Punt et al. 2008).

second_full_simulation_datasets: script to simulate spectra to match with simulated age data and resample to make multiple full datasets for modeling. 

third_full_model_simulation: script to run models using simulated data sets.

fourth_plot_model_simulation: script for plotting results.
